# about this Project :

this Project ( included front-end , back-end and its database ) is analyzed and written only by myself for Cobel Darou Corp. this project is developed by Service-Oriented architecture.
Accually, this project started at May, 2020 and currently is being developed, But more than 90% of first requirements are covered by now.

# Front-end : 

this project was started by Angular 11.0 and then upgrade to Angular 12.0, currently this Project is being developed by Angular 13.0 .
I try to use OOP concepts in designing Forms and Services in TypeScript. 

# Back-end : 

this front-end works with an Apies that written by Asp.Net Web-Api 6.0 as its Back-end. ( [this project is here](https://github.com/YaserMadadi/Cobel.HR.FrontEnd) )

# Database : 

I use Sql Server 2019 for the purpose of Database for this Project. I have designed a BCNF database,
I try to design and develop my projects with Fat-Server / Thin Client approach. It means I try to implement more than 90% of business logics in the Database layer with Stored-procedures to do CRUD and Reports, different types of Functions, Triggers, Check Constraint, Unique Constraints and â€¦
This approach help me to reduce the maintenance time/cost. I have been working with this approach more than 15 years and it really make me different among developers in Iran. Speed of doing projects is another achievement of me to use this method. 
In this project database, I have about 1600 Stored-Procedures, 1100 Functions and many triggers and constraint to implementing Business Logic.
